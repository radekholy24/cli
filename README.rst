Radekholy24's CLI
=================

A demonstration of Radekholy24's competence to develop a CLI in Python.

*Radekholy24's CLI* is being implemented incrementally towards the goal of solving the problem of how to prove
Radekholy24's competence to develop a command-line interface in the Python programming language, by demonstrating his
tastes, knowledge and skills as of 2025. It was inspired by an interview task assigned to him and serves mainly as
something to point other interviewers to. It includes two different implementations so that it demonstrates Radekholy24's
ability to professionally adapt to employers' standards since Radekholy24's personal preferences quite differ from a
common Czech interviewer's expectations.
