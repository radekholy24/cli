=================
Radekholy24's CLI
=================

A CLI to a file server.

*Radekholy24's CLI* is being implemented incrementally towards the goal of developing a command-line interface which
retrieves files from a server, by providing means to select either a REST API or a gRPC API, to query either file
metadata or file contents, and to write the data either to a file or the standard output.

Roughly, the underlying principles that guide the design and implementation are:

* Documentation Driven Development
* reliability, stability, maintainability, and transparency
* The Zen of Python
* You aren't gonna need it
* Keep it simple, stupid

There are no ``AUTHORS``, ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT``, ``CODEOWNERS``, ``CONTRIBUTORS``, ``SECURITY``, and ``SUPPORT`` files as
there are no users and contributors expected. There are no other files yet as the CLI is not implemented yet.

The entire contents of the repository is free and open-source. More precisely, it is distributed under the MIT license
as the author strongly believes in the freedom to use, modify and redistribute any "intellectual property". Since the
laws of the Czech Republic do not allow authors of software to release their work into the public domain, the MIT
license was chosen as the most permissive, popular, and simple and stupid license available. See the ``LICENSE`` file
found in the top-level directory of this distribution. There are no license headers in the contained files as the
repository is always meant to be distributed as whole.
